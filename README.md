# Docker-Guardians-Of-The-Gallery
A secure, dark-themed Flask image gallery that lets authenticated users upload, view, paginate, and delete images. Uploaded files are verified, stripped of metadata, normalized to PNG, and stored by content-based UUID. Missing or malformed requests are redirected to random safe sites.
